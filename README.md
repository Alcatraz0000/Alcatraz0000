### Hi there üëã
I am Ferdinando Sica!! As a passionate technologist with a background in software development, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and interpersonal skills honed from diverse experiences, including roles in the entertainment sector. I have a proven track record in multiple programming languages and frameworks, complemented by my adaptability and problem‚Äêsolving skills. My academic pursuits in computer engineering, with a specialization in artificial intelligence and robotics, have further deepened my proficiency. I‚Äôm eager to leverage these competencies to contribute to dynamic teams and drive impactful software solutions.

### üíº Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ IET** ‚Äì Rome -> Feb. 2023 ‚Äê Today
* I began my journey at IET as an intern and swiftly evolved into a role where I managed a budding project built on SpringBoot, particularly focusing on the creation of RESTful APIs. My role expanded beyond development to encompass leadership responsibilities, managing a dedicated team, and ensuring tasks were methodically allocated and monitored. This position also required me to frequently organize and facilitate communication, orchestrating calls with our clients and collaborating companies integral to the project‚Äôs success. Alongside this primary project, I spent significant time working on transaction management, leveraging tools like Apache Camel and languages such as Java and Groovy to address complex integration challenges.


### üéì Academic backgroud
**Master's Degree in Computer Engineering: Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Robotics** ‚Äì University of Salerno (Italy)
* 109/110 
* During my master‚Äôs program, I delved deep into the realm of convolutional neural networks (CNN), emphasizing their application in artificial vision through machine learning. A unique aspect of our curriculum was the integration of competitive contexts and inter‚Äêclass challenges. These dynamic challenges saw me and my peers competing, often with my contributions placing us high on class leaderboards. The practical side of the course allowed us to design and train ensemble networks, curate custom datasets, and even explore fields such as autonomous driving and virus detection in executable files.

**Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering** ‚Äî University of Salerno (Italy) 
* 101/110
* My undergraduate studies provided a comprehensive foundation in computer engineering and introduced me to the nuances of programming. The curriculum was a blend of object‚Äêoriented programming, ensuring I grasped core design patterns and software architecture principles. I also became proficient in computer networking, understanding the intricate details of network protocols and data transmission. Additionally, I undertook modules on database management, which armed me with the skills to design efficient databases and optimize data storage and retrieval.
